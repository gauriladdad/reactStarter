==============Project description==============

This is a search application for rent properties. It fetches the data using: http://api.nestoria.co.uk/

The search result is displayed in a list with an image and brief description of various matching properties.
Upon further clicking on a property a more detailed page is displayed.

==============Test==============
I have used XCode to test this application.

A default custom location is also defined using XCode.
